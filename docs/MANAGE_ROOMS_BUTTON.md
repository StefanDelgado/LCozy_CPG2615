# Manage Rooms Button Enhancement

## Summary
Removed "Dorm Room Management" from the main navigation and added a "Manage Rooms" button to each dorm card on the Dorm Management page.

## Changes Made

### 1. Navigation Update (`Main/partials/header.php`)
**Removed:**
- "Dorm Room Management" link from owner navigation menu

**Reason:**
- Makes navigation cleaner and more intuitive
- Room management is now accessed contextually from each dorm

### 2. Dorm Card Enhancement (`Main/modules/owner/owner_dorms.php`)

**Added:**
- "Manage Rooms" button next to the "Edit" button on each dorm card
- Button links to: `/modules/admin/room_management.php?dorm_id={dorm_id}`
- Passes the specific dorm ID as a URL parameter

**HTML Structure:**
```html
<div class="dorm-actions">
  <button class="btn-edit-dorm" onclick="openEditDormModal(this)">
    ‚úèÔ∏è Edit
  </button>
  <a href="/modules/admin/room_management.php?dorm_id=<?= $dorm['dorm_id'] ?>" 
     class="btn-manage-rooms">
    üè† Manage Rooms
  </a>
</div>
```

**CSS Added:**
```css
.dorm-actions {
  display: flex;
  gap: 10px;
}

.btn-manage-rooms {
  background: #6f42c1; /* Purple theme */
  color: white;
  border: none;
  padding: 8px 16px;
  border-radius: 6px;
  font-size: 13px;
  font-weight: 600;
  cursor: pointer;
  transition: all 0.3s ease;
  white-space: nowrap;
  text-decoration: none;
  display: inline-flex;
  align-items: center;
}

.btn-manage-rooms:hover {
  background: #5a32a3;
  transform: translateY(-1px);
  box-shadow: 0 3px 8px rgba(111, 66, 193, 0.3);
}
```

## User Experience Improvements

### Before:
- Users had to navigate to "Dorm Room Management" from the main menu
- Had to select which dorm they wanted to manage
- Extra navigation steps

### After:
- Direct access to room management from each dorm card
- Contextual action - manage rooms for the specific dorm you're looking at
- Fewer clicks, more intuitive workflow
- Cleaner navigation menu

## Visual Design
- **Edit Button**: Cyan (#17a2b8) - for editing dorm details
- **Manage Rooms Button**: Purple (#6f42c1) - consistent with theme
- Both buttons have hover effects with slight elevation
- Buttons are grouped together in a flex container with 10px gap
- Icons: ‚úèÔ∏è for Edit, üè† for Manage Rooms

## Technical Notes
- The dorm_id is passed as a URL parameter to the room management page
- Room management page should filter/display rooms for the specific dorm
- Button is an anchor tag (`<a>`) styled as a button for proper navigation
- Maintains accessibility and SEO benefits of proper link elements

## Next Steps (If Needed)
1. Update `room_management.php` to filter by `dorm_id` parameter if not already implemented
2. Add breadcrumb navigation in room management page showing which dorm you're managing
3. Consider adding a "Back to Dorm Management" button in room management page

## Files Modified
1. `Main/partials/header.php` - Removed navigation link
2. `Main/modules/owner/owner_dorms.php` - Added button and styling
