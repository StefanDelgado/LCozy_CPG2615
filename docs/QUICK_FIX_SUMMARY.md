# Quick Fix Summary - Edit & Add Room Buttons

## Problem
Buttons weren't working because JavaScript couldn't handle:
- Multi-line descriptions
- Quotes in dorm names
- Special characters

## Solution
Changed from passing parameters in onclick to using HTML data attributes.

## What Changed

### Before (Broken):
```html
<button onclick="openEditDormModal(1, 'Dorm Name', 'Address with "quotes"', 'Multi
line
description')">
```
❌ Breaks JavaScript syntax

### After (Fixed):
```html
<button data-dorm-id="1" 
        data-dorm-name="Dorm Name"
        onclick="openEditDormModal(this)">
```
✅ Works perfectly!

## Test It
1. **Open your browser console** (F12)
2. Click Edit or Add Room button
3. You should see console logs:
   ```
   openEditDormModal called
   Edit dorm data: {...}
   Edit modal opened
   ```
4. Modal should open with correct data

## If Still Not Working
Check console for errors and verify:
- All modals have correct IDs
- JavaScript has no syntax errors
- Page fully loaded before clicking
