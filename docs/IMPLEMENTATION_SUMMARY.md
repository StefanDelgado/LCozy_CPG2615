## 🔄 Workflow: Student → Tenant

```
1. Student books room
   → Booking: status = 'pending'

2. Owner approves
   → Booking: status = 'approved'
   → Trigger creates: Tenant record (status = 'active')

3. Student pays downpayment
   → Payment: type = 'downpayment', status = 'submitted'

4. Owner verifies payment
   → Payment: status = 'paid' or 'verified'
   → Trigger updates: Tenant.total_paid

5. Move-in date arrives
   → Booking: status = 'active'
   → Tenant: check_in_date set

6. Monthly payments occur
   → Payment: type = 'monthly', status = 'pending' → 'paid'
   → Trigger updates: Tenant.total_paid

7. Move-out date arrives
   → Booking: status = 'completed'
   → Trigger: Tenant status = 'completed', check_out_date set
```

// Monthly rent
$type = 'monthly';

// Utilities
$type = 'utility';
```

### Tenant Status Management
Tenants are automatically managed by triggers, but you can manually update if needed:
```sql
-- Mark tenant as completed
UPDATE tenants 
SET status = 'completed', check_out_date = NOW() 
WHERE tenant_id = ?;
```

### Booking Reference
Automatically generated in format: BK00000001, BK00000002, etc.
