# Room Management Enhancement - Card Layout Redesign

## Summary
Removed "Add Room" functionality from the Dorm Management page and completely redesigned the Room Management page with a modern card-based layout similar to the Dorm Management UI.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dorm Management Page (`Main/modules/owner/owner_dorms.php`)

**Removed:**
- "Add Room" button from section header
- "Add Your First Room" button from empty state
- Entire Add Room modal
- `openRoomModal()` JavaScript function
- Add room form submission handler (moved to room_management.php)

**Updated:**
- Empty state message now says: "No rooms have been added yet. Click 'Manage Rooms' to add rooms to this dormitory."
- Users are directed to use the "Manage Rooms" button on each dorm card

### 2. Room Management Page (`Main/modules/admin/room_management.php`)

      <strong>Current Dorm Name</strong>
    </p>
  </div>
  <button class="btn" onclick="openAddModal()">+ Add Room</button>

## User Experience Improvements

### Before:
- Room management scattered across two pages
- Table-based layout (not very visual)
- No images displayed
- Couldn't filter by specific dorm easily
- Add room functionality in wrong location

### After:
- **Centralized**: All room management in one dedicated page
- **Visual**: Card layout with room images
- **Organized**: Rooms grouped by dormitory
- **Contextual**: Direct access from "Manage Rooms" button on each dorm
- **Informative**: Shows occupancy, size, and status at a glance
- **Professional**: Modern, clean design matching industry standards

## Navigation Flow

### New User Journey:
1. Go to **Dorm Management**
2. View all your dorms in card layout
3. Click **"Manage Rooms"** on specific dorm
4. See only rooms for that dorm
5. Add/Edit/Delete rooms with visual feedback
6. Click breadcrumb to return to Dorm Management

## Technical Features

### URL Filtering:
```
/modules/admin/room_management.php              # All rooms
/modules/admin/room_management.php?dorm_id=5    # Only rooms for dorm #5
```

### Data Attributes Pattern:
```html
<button data-room-id="<?= $r['room_id'] ?>"
        data-room-type="<?= htmlspecialchars($r['room_type']) ?>"
        data-size="<?= $r['size'] ?>"
        data-capacity="<?= $r['capacity'] ?>"
        data-price="<?= $r['price'] ?>"
        data-status="<?= $r['status'] ?>"
        onclick="openEditModal(this)">
```

### Image Upload:
- Supports multiple images per room
- Stored in `/uploads/` directory
- Filenames: `room_[unique_id]_[original_name]`
- Images linked via `room_images` table

### Occupancy Calculation:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM bookings b 
WHERE b.room_id = r.room_id 
AND b.status IN ('approved','active')
```

## Visual Design Elements

### Status Colors:
- **Vacant**: Green (#28a745) - Available for booking
- **Occupied**: Red (#dc3545) - Currently rented

### Action Buttons:
