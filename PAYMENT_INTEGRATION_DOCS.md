## Integration with Student Home

The payments screen is accessible from:
- Quick action button on student home screen
- Shows "Payments Due" count in statistics

## Dependencies Added

**pubspec.yaml:**
```yaml
image_picker: ^1.0.7
```

## Database Schema

The system uses the existing `payments` table:
- `payment_id`: Primary key
- `booking_id`: Foreign key to bookings
- `student_id`: Foreign key to users
- `owner_id`: Foreign key to users (dorm owner)
- `amount`: Payment amount (decimal)
- `status`: enum('pending','paid','expired','rejected','submitted')
- `payment_date`: Timestamp of payment
- `due_date`: Payment due date
- `receipt_image`: Filename of uploaded receipt
- `notes`: Optional notes
- `reminder_sent`: Boolean flag for reminders

## How It Works

1. **Student Views Payments**
   - Opens payments screen from student home
   - API fetches all payments with full details
   - Statistics calculated and displayed
   - Payments sorted by creation date (newest first)

2. **Student Uploads Receipt**
   - Clicks "Upload Receipt" on pending payment
   - Selects image from gallery (using image_picker)
   - Image converted to base64
   - Sent to upload API
   - Status changes to "submitted"
   - Admin can then verify and approve

3. **Payment Status Flow**
   ```
   pending â†’ [student uploads] â†’ submitted â†’ [admin approves] â†’ paid
                                           â†˜ [admin rejects] â†’ rejected
   ```

4. **Overdue Detection**
   - Automatically calculated based on due_date vs current date
   - Marked with red indicator
   - Shows "X days overdue"

## Testing

Tested with:
- **Student Email:** chloe.manalo@email.net
- **Result:** Successfully retrieved 2 payments
  - 1 pending (overdue)
  - 1 paid
