# Dashboard Header/Footer Path Fix

## 🔴 Problem
Admin dashboard loaded without styles/UI - page displayed as plain text without any CSS.

## 🔍 Root Cause
**File:** `dashboards/admin_dashboard.php`

**Issue 1 - Line 42:** Header include path was wrong
```php
// WRONG - Looking in dashboards/partials/ (doesn't exist)
include __DIR__ . '/partials/header.php';
```

**Issue 2 - Line 134:** Footer include path was wrong
```php
// WRONG - Looking in dashboards/partials/ (doesn't exist)
include __DIR__ . '/partials/footer.php';
```

**Why it failed:**
- File location: `Main/dashboards/admin_dashboard.php`
- Tried to include: `Main/dashboards/partials/header.php` ❌ (doesn't exist)
- Actual location: `Main/partials/header.php` ✅
- Need to go UP one level (`../`) then into `partials/`

## ✅ Solution

### Fixed Line 42:
```php
// CORRECT - Go up one level, then into partials/
include __DIR__ . '/../partials/header.php';
```

### Fixed Line 134:
```php
// CORRECT - Go up one level, then into partials/
include __DIR__ . '/../partials/footer.php';
```

## 📊 Verification

### Before Fix:
```
Browser shows: Plain text, no styles
Console error: Failed to load header.php
Result: Unusable dashboard
```

### After Fix:
```
✅ Header included successfully
✅ CSS files loaded (style.css, modules.css)
✅ Sidebar displayed
✅ Dashboard UI rendered properly
✅ All styles applied
```

## 🎯 Other Dashboards

**Checked:**
- ✅ `student_dashboard.php` - Already correct: `require_once __DIR__ . '/../partials/header.php';`
- ✅ `owner_dashboard.php` - Already correct: `require_once __DIR__ . '/../partials/header.php';`
- ❌ `admin_dashboard.php` - Was wrong, NOW FIXED ✅

## 🚀 Deployment

```bash
cd "c:\xampp\htdocs\WebDesign_BSITA-2\2nd sem\Joshan_System\LCozy_CPG2615"

# Add the fix
git add Main/dashboards/admin_dashboard.php

# Commit
git commit -m "Fix admin dashboard: Correct header/footer include paths"

# Push
git push origin main
```

## ✨ Result

After deployment:
- ✅ Admin dashboard loads with full UI
- ✅ All styles applied correctly
- ✅ Sidebar navigation functional
- ✅ Header with user info displayed

## 📝 Path Rules Reminder

### From dashboards/ files:
```php
include __DIR__ . '/../partials/header.php';  ✅ CORRECT
include __DIR__ . '/partials/header.php';     ❌ WRONG
```

### Directory structure:
```
Main/
├── dashboards/
│   ├── admin_dashboard.php    ← You are here
│   ├── owner_dashboard.php
│   └── student_dashboard.php
└── partials/                  ← Need to go UP then here
    ├── header.php
    └── footer.php
```
