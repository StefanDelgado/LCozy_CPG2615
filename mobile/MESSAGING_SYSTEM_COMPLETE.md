# Messaging System - Complete Implementation

## ✅ All Fatal Errors Fixed!

### Issues Found and Resolved:

#### 1. **view_details_screen.dart** - Missing required parameters
**Problem:** ChatConversationScreen was being called with old parameters (otherUserEmail only)
**Solution:** Updated to pass all required parameters:
- `otherUserId` - extracted from owner object
- `otherUserName` - extracted from owner object
- `otherUserEmail` - owner's email
- `dormId` - current dorm ID
- `dormName` - current dorm name
- `currentUserRole` - 'student'

#### 2. **student_home_screen.dart** - Undefined MessagesScreen
**Problem:** Trying to navigate to `MessagesScreen` which doesn't exist
**Solution:** 
- Added import for `ChatListScreen`
- Updated navigation to use `ChatListScreen` with proper parameters

#### 3. **owner_messages_list.dart** - Outdated implementation
**Problem:** Widget using old chat API and wrong ChatConversationScreen parameters
**Solution:** 
- Completely rewrote to simply return `ChatListScreen`
- Removed all old API code
- Now uses the shared messaging system

  dorm_id INT,
  body TEXT,
  created_at DATETIME,
  read_at DATETIME,
