# Payment Screen Navigation Fix

## Problem Found ❌

The owner dashboard was importing the **LEGACY/OLD** payment screen instead of the new one!

```dart
// OLD - This was being used
import '../../legacy/MobileScreen/ownerpayments.dart';
```

That's why you didn't see the new buttons - the dashboard was still loading the old screen!

## Solution ✅

Updated `owner_dashboard_screen.dart` to import the **NEW** payment screen:

```dart
// NEW - Now using this
import 'owner_payments_screen.dart';
```

## What Changed

**File:** `lib/screens/owner/owner_dashboard_screen.dart`

**Added (line 10):**
```dart
import 'owner_payments_screen.dart'; // NEW payment screen with buttons
```

**Removed (line 12):**
```dart
// import '../../legacy/MobileScreen/ownerpayments.dart'; // OLD version (commented out)
```

## To See the Fix

**⚠️ MUST Hot Restart:**

1. Stop the app completely
2. Run again: `flutter run`
3. OR press **Ctrl+Shift+F5**

Then:
1. Login as owner
2. Click **Payments** tab
3. You'll now see the **NEW screen** with all the buttons! ✅

## What You'll Now See

### OLD Screen (was showing):
- Basic payment list
- No buttons
- No actions

### NEW Screen (now shows):
- ✅ View Receipt button
- ✅ Complete Payment button (green)
- ✅ Reject Payment button (red)
- ✅ Functional filters
- ✅ Better status detection

## Why This Happened

Your project has **TWO payment screens**:

1. **Legacy**: `lib/legacy/MobileScreen/ownerpayments.dart` (old)
2. **New**: `lib/screens/owner/owner_payments_screen.dart` (updated)

We updated the NEW screen, but the dashboard was still loading the OLD one!

Now it's fixed - dashboard loads the new screen! 🎉

## Status
✅ Import fixed
✅ No errors
✅ Ready to test - just restart!
