# Room Management Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Screen Not Refreshing After Add/Edit/Delete**
- **Status:** ‚úÖ Already working correctly
- **Details:** The code already calls `fetchRooms()` after successful operations
- **Location:** `room_management_screen.dart` lines 63-160

### 2. **API Format Mismatch (ok vs success)**
- **Problem:** APIs return `{ok: true}` but mobile app expected `{success: true}`
- **Solution:** Updated all room service methods to handle both formats
- **Files Modified:**
  - `lib/services/room_service.dart`
    - `getRoomsByDorm()` - Now checks both `ok` and `success`
    - `addRoom()` - Now checks both `ok` and `success`
    - `updateRoom()` - Now checks both `ok` and `success`
    - `deleteRoom()` - Now checks both `ok` and `success`

### 3. **Room Shows "Occupied" When Added**
- **Problem:** RoomCard was checking wrong field (`is_available` instead of `status`)
- **API Default:** Rooms are created with status `'vacant'` by default
- **Solution:** Updated RoomCard to read `status` field correctly
- **Files Modified:**
  - `lib/widgets/owner/dorms/room_card.dart`
    - Now reads `status` field from API
    - Shows "Vacant" for `vacant`/`available` status
    - Shows actual status (OCCUPIED, MAINTENANCE, etc.) for other statuses

### 4. **Capacity Display Enhancement**
- **Problem:** Only showed max capacity, not current occupants
- **Solution:** Added current occupant count display
- **Files Modified:**
  - `Main/modules/mobile-api/fetch_rooms.php`
    - Added `current_occupants` field (count of approved bookings)
  - `lib/widgets/owner/dorms/room_card.dart`
    - Changed from "Capacity: 4" to "Occupants: 0 / 4"
    - Shows real-time booking count

## Debug Logging Added

All room service methods now include detailed debug logging:
- ‚ûï Add room operations
- ‚úèÔ∏è Edit room operations
- üóëÔ∏è Delete room operations
- üè† Fetch rooms operations

Logs show:
- Request data being sent
- API response status and body
- Success/failure messages
- Error details

## Room Card Improvements

**Before:**
```
Room Type
Capacity: 4
‚Ç±5,000/month    [Available/Occupied]
```

**After:**
```
Room Type #101
Occupants: 2 / 4
‚Ç±5,000/month    [VACANT/OCCUPIED/MAINTENANCE]
```

Changes:
1. Shows room number if available
2. Shows current occupants vs capacity
3. Displays actual room status from database
4. Uses correct status field from API

## API Compatibility

The mobile app now handles both response formats:
- Legacy: `{ok: true, data: [...]}`
- Standard: `{success: true, data: [...]}`
- Error: `{error: "message"}`

This ensures compatibility with existing server APIs without requiring backend changes.

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Add room ‚Üí Should show "Vacant" status
- [ ] Add room ‚Üí Should show "Occupants: 0 / [capacity]"
- [ ] Edit room ‚Üí Screen should refresh automatically
- [ ] Delete room ‚Üí Screen should refresh automatically
- [ ] Room with booking ‚Üí Should show "Occupants: 1 / [capacity]"
- [ ] Check terminal logs for API responses

## Notes

- Default room status is `'vacant'` (set in `add_room_api.php`)
- Current occupants = count of approved bookings
- Room number display is optional (shows if present)
- Status display is case-insensitive and converts to uppercase
