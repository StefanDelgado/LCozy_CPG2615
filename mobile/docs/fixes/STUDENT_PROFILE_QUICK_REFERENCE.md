## 💡 Tips

1. **Profile Tab** is the 5th icon in bottom navigation (person icon)
2. **Back button** in AppBar returns to home
3. **Logout** shows confirmation dialog - won't logout by accident
4. **My Bookings** is fully functional - navigates to reservations
5. **Coming Soon** features have placeholders ready for future implementation

## 🎯 Comparison

**Before:**
```dart
case 4: // Profile
  ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
    const SnackBar(content: Text('Profile feature coming soon')),
  );
```

**After:**
```dart
case 4: // Profile
  Navigator.push(
    context,
    MaterialPageRoute(
      builder: (context) => StudentProfileScreen(
        studentName: widget.userName,
        studentEmail: widget.userEmail,
      ),
    ),
  );
```

---

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE & READY TO USE**

*The student profile feature is now fully functional and matches the quality of the owner profile!*
