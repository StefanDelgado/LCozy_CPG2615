# Booking Approval Fix

## 🐛 Issue Description

**Problem:** When trying to approve a booking request, the app shows error: **"Exception: owner email required"**

**Root Cause:** The API endpoint `owner_bookings_api.php` only had code to **fetch** bookings (GET request), but was missing the logic to **approve/reject** bookings (POST request).

---

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### 1. **Added POST Request Handler to API**

**File:** `owner_bookings_api.php`

**Problem:** API only handled GET requests for fetching bookings.

**Fix:** Added complete POST request handling for approve/reject actions:

```php
// Handle POST requests for booking actions (approve/reject)
if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] === 'POST') {
    $action = $_POST['action'] ?? '';
    $booking_id = $_POST['booking_id'] ?? '';
    $owner_email = $_POST['owner_email'] ?? '';

    // Validate parameters
    if (!$owner_email) {
        echo json_encode(['ok' => false, 'error' => 'Owner email required']);
        exit;
    }

    if (!$booking_id) {
        echo json_encode(['ok' => false, 'error' => 'Booking ID required']);
        exit;
    }

    if (!in_array($action, ['approve', 'reject'])) {
        echo json_encode(['ok' => false, 'error' => 'Invalid action']);
        exit;
    }

    // Verify owner exists and has permission
    // Update booking status
    // Mark room as unavailable if approved
    // Return success response
}
```

**Features Added:**
- ✅ Validates owner email exists
- ✅ Validates booking belongs to owner's dorm
- ✅ Updates booking status to 'approved' or 'rejected'
- ✅ Marks room as unavailable when booking is approved
- ✅ Returns success/error response

---

### 2. **API Response Field Consistency**

**Problem:** API returned `'id'` but Flutter code expected `'booking_id'`.

**Fix:** Added both fields for consistency:

```php
$formatted = array_map(function($b) {
    return [
        'id' => $b['id'],
        'booking_id' => $b['id'], // ✅ Added for consistency
        'student_email' => $b['student_email'],
        'student_name' => $b['student_name'],
        // ... other fields
    ];
}, $bookings);
```

---

### 3. **Enhanced Flutter Error Handling**

**File:** `owner_booking_screen.dart`

**Added:**
- Debug logging to track approval flow
- Better error messages
- Fallback for booking_id field

```dart
Future<void> _approveBooking(Map<String, dynamic> booking) async {
  print('📋 [OwnerBooking] Approve booking clicked');
  print('📋 [OwnerBooking] Booking data: $booking');
  print('📋 [OwnerBooking] Owner email: ${widget.ownerEmail}');

  // Try both 'booking_id' and 'id' fields
  final bookingId = booking['booking_id'] ?? booking['id'];
  
  if (bookingId == null) {
    // Show error to user
    return;
  }

  // Proceed with approval
}
```

---

### 4. **Added Debug Logging to Service**

**File:** `booking_service.dart`

**Added comprehensive logging:**

```dart
Future<Map<String, dynamic>> updateBookingStatus({
  required String bookingId,
  required String action,
  required String ownerEmail,
}) async {
  print('📋 [BookingService] Updating booking status...');
  print('📋 [BookingService] Booking ID: $bookingId');
  print('📋 [BookingService] Action: $action');
  print('📋 [BookingService] Owner Email: $ownerEmail');

  // ... API call ...

  print('📋 [BookingService] Response status: ${response.statusCode}');
  print('📋 [BookingService] Response body: ${response.body}');
}
```

## 🔄 Complete Approval Flow

### Before Fix (BROKEN):

```
Owner clicks "Approve" button
         ↓
Flutter sends POST to owner_bookings_api.php
         ↓
❌ API only has GET handler
         ↓
❌ Error: "owner email required"
```

### After Fix (WORKING):

```
Owner clicks "Approve" button
         ↓
📋 [OwnerBooking] Approve booking clicked
         ↓
📋 [BookingService] POST to API with:
   - action: 'approve'
   - booking_id: '123'
   - owner_email: 'owner@example.com'
         ↓
🔧 API receives POST request
         ↓
✅ Validates owner email
✅ Validates booking ID
✅ Checks owner owns the dorm
         ↓
✅ UPDATE bookings SET status = 'approved'
✅ UPDATE rooms SET is_available = 0
         ↓
✅ Returns: {"ok": true, "message": "Booking approved successfully"}
         ↓
📋 [BookingService] ✅ Booking updated successfully
         ↓
🎉 Show success message
🔄 Refresh booking list
```

## 📋 API Request/Response Format

### Approve Booking (POST)

**Request:**
```
POST /modules/mobile-api/owner_bookings_api.php

Body (form-data):
  action: "approve"
  booking_id: "123"
  owner_email: "owner@example.com"
```

**Success Response:**
```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "message": "Booking approved successfully"
}
```

**Error Responses:**
```json
// Missing owner email
{
  "ok": false,
  "error": "Owner email required"
}

// Missing booking ID
{
  "ok": false,
  "error": "Booking ID required"
}

// Invalid action
{
  "ok": false,
  "error": "Invalid action"
}

// Owner not found
{
  "ok": false,
  "error": "Owner not found"
}

// Booking not found or access denied
{
  "ok": false,
  "error": "Booking not found or access denied"
}
```

## 🗄️ Database Changes

### When Booking is Approved:

**1. Update bookings table:**
```sql
UPDATE bookings 
SET status = 'approved' 
WHERE booking_id = ?
```

**2. Mark room as unavailable:**
```sql
UPDATE rooms 
SET is_available = 0 
WHERE room_id = ?
```

---

## 🔒 Security Validations

The API now validates:

1. ✅ **Owner Email Exists:** Checks user exists and has 'owner' role
2. ✅ **Booking Ownership:** Verifies booking belongs to owner's dorm
3. ✅ **Action Validity:** Only allows 'approve' or 'reject'
4. ✅ **Booking Exists:** Checks booking record exists

**SQL Query for Verification:**
```sql
SELECT b.booking_id, b.status, d.owner_id, b.room_id
FROM bookings b
JOIN rooms r ON b.room_id = r.room_id
JOIN dormitories d ON r.dorm_id = d.dorm_id
WHERE b.booking_id = ? AND d.owner_id = ?
```

This ensures owners can only approve bookings for their own dorms.
