# Logout Navigation Stack Fix

## 🐛 Bug Description

**Issue:** When switching between student and owner accounts via login/logout, navigating back from messages would redirect to the previously logged-out user's screen.

**Root Cause:** The logout function was using `pushReplacementNamed()` which only replaces the current route but doesn't clear the entire navigation stack. This meant that when a new user logged in, the old user's navigation history (including messages, dorm details, etc.) was still in memory.

## ✅ Fix Applied

Changed both student and owner logout functions to use `pushNamedAndRemoveUntil()` with a predicate that removes ALL previous routes.

### Before (Broken):
```dart
Navigator.pushReplacementNamed(context, '/login');
```
- Only replaces the current route
- Keeps all previous routes in the stack
- Pressing back can navigate to previous user's screens

### After (Fixed):
```dart
Navigator.of(context).pushNamedAndRemoveUntil(
  '/login',
  (route) => false, // Remove all previous routes
);
```
- Clears the ENTIRE navigation stack
- Only the login screen remains
- No way to navigate back to previous user's screens

## 🧪 How to Test

1. **Login as Student**
   - Browse dorms
   - View dorm details
   - Go to Messages
   - Open a conversation

2. **Logout from Student**
   - Go to Profile
   - Click Logout
   - Confirm logout

3. **Login as Owner**
   - Go to Messages tab
   - Open a conversation
   - Press back button

4. **Expected Result: ✅**
   - Should return to Owner's Messages list
   - Should NOT return to Student's screens
   - Navigation stack is clean for the new user

5. **Test Again in Reverse**
   - Logout from Owner
   - Login as Student
   - Navigate through app
   - Press back repeatedly
   - Should NOT see any Owner screens

## 🎯 What This Fixes

✅ **Navigation Stack Isolation** - Each user session has a fresh navigation stack
✅ **No Cross-User Navigation** - Can't accidentally navigate to previous user's screens
✅ **Clean Logout** - Complete session termination
✅ **Security Improvement** - Previous user's data/screens not accessible
✅ **Better UX** - No confusing navigation to wrong user's content

## 🔒 Security Benefits

This fix also improves security:
- Previous user's sensitive information is not accessible via back navigation
- Chat conversations are properly isolated per user
- No leaked navigation state between user sessions

---

## 📝 Implementation Notes

The key difference:
- `pushReplacement` = Replace only the top route
- `pushNamedAndRemoveUntil` with `(route) => false` = Clear ALL routes and push new one

This ensures a completely fresh start for each login session.

## ✅ Status: FIXED

The navigation stack is now properly cleared on logout for both student and owner accounts. No more cross-user navigation bugs!
