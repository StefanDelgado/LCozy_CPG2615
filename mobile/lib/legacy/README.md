# Legacy Code Directory

## Purpose

These files are kept for:
1. **Reference** - Original implementations for comparison
2. **Backup** - Fallback in case new implementations need verification

## Temporary Dependencies

The new refactored screens still import from legacy for:
- `student_owner_chat.dart` - Used by multiple screens (chat functionality)
- `ownerbooking.dart`, `ownerpayments.dart`, `ownertenants.dart`, `ownersetting.dart`, `ownerdorms.dart` - Used by owner dashboard

## Migration Plan

### Phase 1: ✅ Completed
- [x] Refactor viewdetails.dart
- [x] Refactor student_home.dart
- [x] Refactor student_payments.dart
- [x] Refactor ownerdashboard.dart
- [x] Move old files to legacy/

### Phase 2: ✅ Completed
- [x] Refactor browse_dorms.dart → browse_dorms_screen.dart
- [x] Refactor booking_form.dart → booking_form_screen.dart
- [x] Update all student screen imports
- [x] Fix all lint warnings and errors

### Phase 3: Future Work
- [ ] Refactor remaining owner screens (ownerdorms, ownertenants, ownerpayments, ownerbooking)
- [ ] Move authentication screens to `screens/auth/`
- [ ] Move shared screens to `screens/shared/`
- [ ] Create proper chat screen wrapper
- [ ] Create proper booking form wrapper
- [ ] Update all imports to remove legacy dependencies

### Phase 3: Cleanup
- [ ] Verify all functionality with new screens
- [ ] Remove legacy imports from new code
- [ ] Delete legacy folder (after thorough testing)

## Usage

### When to Reference Legacy Code
- When implementing similar features in new screens
- When debugging differences in behavior
- When verifying original logic flow
- When migrating remaining screens

### When NOT to Use Legacy Code
- For new feature development (use new architecture)
- For bug fixes (fix in new refactored code)
- For performance improvements (optimize new code)

## Notes

⚠️ **Do not modify files in this directory!**
- These are kept for reference only
- All active development should use the new refactored structure
- Any bugs found should be fixed in the new implementation
