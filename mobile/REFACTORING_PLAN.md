## Files to Refactor (Priority Order)

### HIGH PRIORITY - Most Used Files

#### 1. viewdetails.dart (681 lines) → Break into:
- `screens/student/view_details_screen.dart` (Main screen ~150 lines)
- `widgets/student/view_details/overview_tab.dart`
- `widgets/student/view_details/rooms_tab.dart`
- `widgets/student/view_details/reviews_tab.dart`
- `widgets/student/view_details/contact_tab.dart`
- `widgets/student/view_details/stat_chip.dart`

#### 2. student_home.dart (539 lines) → Break into:
- `screens/student/student_home_screen.dart` (Main screen ~200 lines)
- `widgets/student/dashboard_stats_card.dart`
- `widgets/student/quick_action_button.dart`
- `widgets/student/booking_list_item.dart`

#### 3. student_payments.dart (502 lines) → Break into:
- `screens/student/payments/student_payments_screen.dart` (Main ~200 lines)
- `widgets/student/payment_stat_card.dart`
- `widgets/student/payment_card.dart`

#### 4. booking_form.dart (459 lines) → Keep as:
- `screens/student/booking_form_screen.dart`
- Extract validators to utils

### MEDIUM PRIORITY - Owner Screens

#### 5. ownerdashboard.dart (696 lines) → Break into:
- `screens/owner/owner_dashboard_screen.dart`
- `widgets/owner/dashboard_stat_card.dart`
- `widgets/owner/recent_bookings_widget.dart`

#### 6. ownerdorms.dart (681 lines) → Break into:
- `screens/owner/owner_dorms_screen.dart`
- `widgets/owner/dorm_card.dart`
- `widgets/owner/dorm_form_dialog.dart`

#### 7. ownertenants.dart (567 lines) → Break into:
- `screens/owner/owner_tenants_screen.dart`
- `widgets/owner/tenant_card.dart` (already exists - consolidate)

### LOW PRIORITY - Smaller Files

#### 8. Other screens → Just move to proper folders:
- `Login.dart` → `screens/auth/login_screen.dart`
- `Register.dart` → `screens/auth/register_screen.dart`
- `browse_dorms.dart` → `screens/student/browse_dorms_screen.dart`
- `student_owner_chat.dart` → `screens/shared/chat_screen.dart`
- `profile.dart` → `screens/shared/profile_screen.dart`
- `notification.dart` → `screens/shared/notification_screen.dart`
- `home.dart` → `screens/shared/home_screen.dart`

## Benefits of Refactoring

1. **Maintainability**: Easier to find and fix bugs
2. **Reusability**: Widgets can be reused across screens
3. **Readability**: Smaller files are easier to understand
4. **Testing**: Smaller components are easier to test
5. **Collaboration**: Team members can work on different components
6. **Performance**: Better code splitting and lazy loading

## Migration Plan

### Phase 1: Utilities & Common Widgets (DONE ✅)
- [x] Create utils folder with constants, helpers, validators
- [x] Create common widgets (loading, error)

### Phase 2: Student Screens (IN PROGRESS)
- [ ] Refactor viewdetails.dart (most complex)

- [ ] Refactor student_payments.dart
- [ ] Move other student screens

### Phase 3: Owner Screens
- [ ] Refactor owner dashboard
- [ ] Refactor owner dorms
- [ ] Refactor owner tenants
- [ ] Move other owner screens

### Phase 4: Auth & Shared Screens
- [ ] Move auth screens
- [ ] Move shared screens
- [ ] Update all imports

### Phase 5: Cleanup

- [ ] Test all screens
- [ ] Update documentation

## Import Changes Required

After refactoring, update imports from:
```dart
import 'MobileScreen/viewdetails.dart';
```

To:
```dart
import 'package:cozydorm/screens/student/view_details_screen.dart';
```

## Notes
- Keep backward compatibility during migration
- Test each screen after refactoring
- Update exports in each folder
- Create index.dart files for easier imports
