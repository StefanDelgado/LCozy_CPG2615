# Booking Button Debug Enhancement - Complete

## Overview
Enhanced the approve/reject booking buttons with comprehensive debugging and loading state management to improve error visibility and prevent multiple clicks.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Loading State Management

**File: `lib/screens/owner/owner_booking_screen.dart`**

Added `_isProcessing` state variable:
```dart
bool _isProcessing = false; // Track if approve/reject is in progress
```

This prevents multiple button clicks while an operation is in progress.

### 2. Enhanced _approveBooking() Method

**Key Improvements:**
- ‚úÖ Added early return check if already processing
- ‚úÖ Set `_isProcessing = true` at start
- ‚úÖ Show loading SnackBar with spinner during API call
- ‚úÖ Clear loading indicator when done
- ‚úÖ Reset `_isProcessing = false` in finally block
- ‚úÖ Enhanced debug logging with separators
- ‚úÖ Log every step: entry, parameters, API call, response, errors
- ‚úÖ Capture stack traces on errors
- ‚úÖ Increased error SnackBar duration to 5 seconds

**Debug Logging Added:**
```
üìã [OwnerBooking] ======== APPROVE BOOKING CLICKED ========
üìã [OwnerBooking] Full booking data: {...}
üìã [OwnerBooking] Owner email: ...
üìã [OwnerBooking] Context mounted: true/false
üìã [OwnerBooking] Extracted booking_id: ... (type: int)
üìã [OwnerBooking] Starting approval process...
üìã [OwnerBooking] Calling updateBookingStatus with:
üìã [OwnerBooking]   - bookingId: ...
üìã [OwnerBooking]   - action: approve
üìã [OwnerBooking]   - ownerEmail: ...
üìã [OwnerBooking] ‚è≥ Awaiting API response...
üìã [OwnerBooking] ======== API RESPONSE RECEIVED ========
üìã [OwnerBooking] Full result: {...}
üìã [OwnerBooking] Success: true/false
üìã [OwnerBooking] Message: ...
üìã [OwnerBooking] ======== APPROVE BOOKING COMPLETE ========
```

**Error Handling:**
```
üìã [OwnerBooking] ======== EXCEPTION CAUGHT ========
üìã [OwnerBooking] ‚ùå Error type: ...
üìã [OwnerBooking] ‚ùå Error message: ...
üìã [OwnerBooking] ‚ùå Stack trace: ...
```

### 3. Enhanced _rejectBooking() Method

**Same enhancements as approve:**
- ‚úÖ Added early return check if already processing
- ‚úÖ Set `_isProcessing = true` after confirmation
- ‚úÖ Show loading SnackBar with spinner
- ‚úÖ Clear loading indicator when done
- ‚úÖ Reset `_isProcessing = false` in finally block
- ‚úÖ Same comprehensive debug logging
- ‚úÖ Same error handling with stack traces

### 4. Updated BookingCard Widget

**File: `lib/widgets/owner/bookings/booking_card.dart`**

**Added Parameter:**
```dart
final bool isProcessing;

const BookingCard({
  // ... other parameters
  this.isProcessing = false,
});
```

**Button Behavior Changes:**
- Buttons are disabled when `isProcessing = true`
- Shows loading spinner instead of icon when processing
- Prevents clicking while an operation is in progress

**Reject Button:**
```dart
onPressed: isProcessing ? null : onReject,
icon: isProcessing 
  ? CircularProgressIndicator(...)
  : Icon(Icons.cancel, size: 20),
```

**Approve Button:**
```dart
onPressed: isProcessing ? null : onApprove,
icon: isProcessing 
  ? CircularProgressIndicator(...)
  : Icon(Icons.check_circle, size: 20),
```

### 5. Updated BookingCard Usage

**File: `lib/screens/owner/owner_booking_screen.dart`**

```dart
BookingCard(
  booking: booking,
  onApprove: () => _approveBooking(booking),
  onReject: () => _rejectBooking(booking),
  isProcessing: _isProcessing,  // ‚Üê NEW
);
```

## Testing Checklist

Test the following scenarios:

- [ ] Click approve button - should see loading indicator
- [ ] Click approve while processing - should ignore click
- [ ] Successful approval - should show green success message
- [ ] Failed approval - should show red error message for 5 seconds
- [ ] Click reject button - should see confirmation dialog
- [ ] Click reject while processing - should ignore click
- [ ] Successful rejection - should show orange success message
- [ ] Failed rejection - should show red error message for 5 seconds
- [ ] Check console logs - should see all debug messages
- [ ] Error scenario - should see stack trace in logs

## How to Use Logs for Debugging

1. **Run the app in debug mode**
2. **Open Flutter DevTools or console**
3. **Click approve/reject button**
4. **Look for the emoji prefix:** üìã [OwnerBooking]
5. **Follow the flow:**
   - CLICKED ‚Üê Button pressed
   - Parameters logged ‚Üê What was sent
   - API response ‚Üê What was received
   - Exception (if any) ‚Üê Error details with stack trace
   - COMPLETE ‚Üê Operation finished

## Error Scenarios to Test

1. **Network Error:** Turn off internet, click approve
2. **Invalid Booking ID:** Manually test with null booking_id
3. **Owner Verification Fail:** Test with wrong owner_email
4. **API Error:** Server returns error response
5. **Context Not Mounted:** Navigate away quickly after clicking

Each scenario should now show clear error messages and detailed logs.

‚úÖ Added loading indicators during processing
‚úÖ Prevented multiple clicks with state management
‚úÖ Added comprehensive debug logging
