## Pre-Deployment (Do Once)

### âœ… Step 1: Backup Everything
```bash
# Backup database
mysqldump -u root -p cozydorms > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql

# Backup files (optional)
cp -r Main/ Main_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d)/
```

### âœ… Step 2: Run Database Migration
```bash
# Option A: Via phpMyAdmin
1. Open http://localhost/phpmyadmin
2. Select 'cozydorms' database
3. Click "SQL" tab
4. Copy entire database_migrations.sql
5. Paste and click "Go"

# Option B: Command Line
mysql -u root -p cozydorms < database_migrations.sql
```

### âœ… Step 3: Verify Migration
```sql
-- Check tables
SHOW TABLES LIKE 'tenants';
SHOW TABLES LIKE 'dorm_images';
SHOW TABLES LIKE 'user_preferences';
SHOW TABLES LIKE 'payment_schedules';

-- Check triggers
SHOW TRIGGERS;

-- Check views
SHOW FULL TABLES WHERE TABLE_TYPE LIKE 'VIEW';

-- Verify data
SELECT COUNT(*) as TotalTenants FROM tenants;
SELECT COUNT(*) as BookingsWithRef FROM bookings WHERE booking_reference IS NOT NULL;
```

### âœ… Step 4: Test Access
```
Login as Owner:

## Quick Commands Reference

### Database
```sql
-- View all booking statuses
SELECT booking_id, status, booking_reference FROM bookings;

-- View all payment types
SELECT payment_id, payment_type, status, amount FROM payments ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;

-- View active tenants
SELECT * FROM view_active_tenants;

-- View owner stats
SELECT * FROM view_owner_stats WHERE owner_id = ?;
```

### Create Sample Tenant
```sql
-- If you need to manually create a tenant for testing
INSERT INTO tenants (booking_id, student_id, dorm_id, room_id, status, check_in_date, expected_checkout)
SELECT b.booking_id, b.student_id, r.dorm_id, b.room_id, 'active', b.start_date, b.end_date
FROM bookings b
JOIN rooms r ON b.room_id = r.room_id
WHERE b.booking_id = ? AND b.status = 'approved';
```

### Create Payment with Type
```php
// Downpayment
$stmt = $pdo->prepare("
  INSERT INTO payments (booking_id, student_id, owner_id, amount, payment_type, due_date, status)
  VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, 'downpayment', ?, 'pending')
");

// Monthly
$stmt = $pdo->prepare("
  INSERT INTO payments (booking_id, student_id, owner_id, amount, payment_type, due_date, status)
  VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, 'monthly', ?, 'pending')
");
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Table 'tenants' doesn't exist"
**Fix:** Run database migration script

### Issue: "No tenants showing"
**Fix:** Check if bookings are approved:
```sql
-- See approved bookings
SELECT * FROM bookings WHERE status = 'approved';

-- Manually create tenant records if needed
INSERT INTO tenants (booking_id, student_id, dorm_id, room_id, status, check_in_date, expected_checkout)
SELECT b.booking_id, b.student_id, r.dorm_id, b.room_id, 'active', b.start_date, b.end_date
FROM bookings b
JOIN rooms r ON b.room_id = r.room_id
WHERE b.status = 'approved';
```

### Issue: "Payment type not showing"
**Fix:** Check column exists:
```sql
SHOW COLUMNS FROM payments LIKE 'payment_type';

-- If doesn't exist, run migration again
```

### Issue: "Triggers not working"
**Fix:** Check triggers exist:
```sql
SHOW TRIGGERS;

-- If missing, run the trigger section from migration script
```
